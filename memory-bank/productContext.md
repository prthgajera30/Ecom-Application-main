# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Modern e-commerce applications require complex coordination between multiple systems: user authentication, inventory management, payment processing, personalization, and real-time updates. Building these systems from scratch is time-consuming and error-prone, requiring deep knowledge across multiple technologies and domains.

### Market Need

- **Entrepreneurs** need a solid foundation to launch their online stores quickly
- **Teams** need a reference architecture for building scalable e-commerce platforms
- **Educators** need teaching examples of modern full-stack development practices

### Solution
A complete, feature-rich e-commerce platform that demonstrates:
- Modern full-stack development practices
- Microservices architecture with proper separation of concerns
- End-to-end user journeys from authentication to order fulfillment
- Integration of machine learning for personalization
- DevOps practices with containerization and automated deployment

## How It Should Work

### User Journeys

#### Guest User Flow

#### Returning Customer Flow
1. **Personalization**: See personalized recommendations based on past behavior
2. **Re-engagement**: Abandoned cart recovery, order status updates
3. **Loyalty Features**: Order history, saved preferences, quick reorder
