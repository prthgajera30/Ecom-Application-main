# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
*Memory Bank initialized - establishing baseline project context*

This is a freshly initialized e-commerce application project. The codebase contains a complete full-stack implementation with established patterns and architecture.

## Recent Changes
- **Memory Bank Created**: Project documentation framework established
- **Baseline Assessment**: Core architecture and technology stack documented
- **Status Quo**: All services appear to be functional based on file structure analysis

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
- **Validate Environment Setup**: Confirm local development environment works correctly
- **Database Connectivity**: Ensure Prisma migrations and seeding work as expected
- **Service Integration**: Verify all three services (web, api, recs) communicate properly
- **Test Suite Execution**: Run existing test suites to establish baseline functionality

### Development Priorities
- **Feature Completeness**: Assess current feature set against project brief requirements
- **Performance Optimization**: Evaluate current performance characteristics
- **Security Audit**: Review authentication, authorization, and data protection measures
- **Documentation Updates**: Align codebase documentation with established patterns

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architectural Decisions
- **Microservices Boundary**: Clear separation maintained between web frontend, API backend, and ML service
- **Monorepo Strategy**: Single repository approach validated for this scale of project
- **Technology Choices**: Next.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL stack deemed appropriate for requirements

### Development Workflow
- **Local Development**: Docker Compose setup enables consistent development environment
- **Testing Strategy**: Mix of unit tests (Jest), integration tests, and E2E tests (Playwright) established
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + TypeScript provides strong typing and consistent code style

### Scalability Considerations
- **Service Independence**: Architecture supports independent scaling of components
- **Database Design**: Prisma schema appears well-structured for e-commerce domain
- **API Design**: RESTful patterns with proper error handling and validation

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Organization
- **API Structure**: Clear separation of routes, services, and database operations
- **Frontend Architecture**: Component-based structure with clear separation of concerns
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error response formats across API endpoints
- **State Management**: Context-based state management with domain-specific providers

### Database Patterns
- **Migration Strategy**: Incremental migrations with proper rollback capability
- **Seeding Strategy**: Development data seeding for consistent testing environment
- **Query Optimization**: Strategic use of Prisma's include/select for N+1 query prevention

### Security Patterns
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with secure cookie storage
- **Validation**: Schema-based validation on all API inputs
- **Authorization**: Route-level middleware for access control

## Learnings & Project Insights

### Technical Insights
- **TypeScript Benefits**: Strong typing prevents runtime errors and improves developer experience
- **Prisma Advantages**: ORM provides excellent developer experience with type safety
- **Docker Benefits**: Containerization ensures environment consistency across team members

### Architecture Insights
- **Microservices Complexity**: Clear boundaries require careful API contract management
- **Monorepo Benefits**: Atomic changes and shared code reduce coordination overhead
- **Service Communication**: HTTP REST provides reliable inter-service communication for this use case

### Development Insights
- **Testing Importance**: Comprehensive test suite crucial for maintaining code quality
- **Documentation Value**: Memory Bank approach ensures project continuity across sessions
- **Iterative Development**: Incremental approach allows for continuous validation of assumptions

## Current Environment Status
- **Node.js**: 20+ required (check .nvmrc)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm workspaces configured
- **Database**: PostgreSQL setup with Prisma
- **Services**: Three service architecture (web, api, recs)
- **Containerization**: Docker Compose for local development
- **Testing**: Jest + Playwright test suites established

## Risk Considerations
- **Environment Setup Complexity**: Docker + multi-service setup requires proper configuration
- **Service Dependencies**: API service dependent on database and external services
- **Development Experience**: Ensuring smooth developer onboarding and workflow

## Success Metrics
- **Functional Completeness**: All e-commerce workflows (browse → cart → checkout) operational
- **Performance Targets**: Meet established performance benchmarks
- **Code Quality**: Maintain high test coverage and code standards
- **Developer Experience**: Smooth local development and deployment processes
