# Project Brief: Ecom-Application

## Overview
This is a full-stack e-commerce application built as a monorepo containing multiple interconnected services. The project implements a modern e-commerce platform with user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, checkout, order management, and personalized recommendations.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **Product Catalog**: Browse, search, filter products with variants (size, color, etc.)
- **Shopping Cart**: Add/remove items, persist cart state, handle variants
- **Checkout Process**: Secure payment integration, order creation, success/cancel flows
- **Order Management**: View order history, order details, status tracking
- **Recommendations**: Personalized product suggestions using machine learning
- **Review System**: Product reviews and ratings
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live features

### Technical Requirements
- **Microservices Architecture**: Separate API, web frontend, and recommendation services
- **Containerized Deployment**: Docker-based development and production environments
- **Modern Stack**: TypeScript, Next.js, Prisma ORM, Python for ML services
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with automated migrations and seeding
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with unit, integration, and E2E tests
- **Development Experience**: Hot-reloading, development scripts, local database setup

## Goals
1. **Production-Ready E-commerce Platform**: Feature-complete solution suitable for real-world use
2. **Modern Development Practices**: Clean architecture, best practices, maintainable codebase
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Microservices design supporting horizontal scaling
4. **Developer Experience**: Easy setup, comprehensive documentation, automated workflows

## Success Criteria
- All core e-commerce workflows functional (browse → cart → checkout → orders)
- Automated testing covering critical paths
- Docker-based deployment working in development and production
- Performance sufficient for typical e-commerce scale
- Code quality maintained through linting and testing
